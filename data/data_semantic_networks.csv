"1","I have always been interested in UCLA, I was at the university web page when I knew about the program so I just followed the links and understood the the ALC program works.","I know that UCLA is well recognized in this country so I had high expectations about how the classes would be.","Reading and writing classes. I never get bored with Michael and is helping me a lot developing my skills.","So far, everything is looking good for me.","I studied English in Peru for a couple of years, I think it helped me a lot with my grammar. also I have worked for a Chinese - Australian company in which the communication flow some days was entirely in English.","After finishing school I started working a mining company, I started my career being a executive assistants. After that I went through a couple of roles until I got the one that i was aiming for, I had a project administrator role for a feasibility study to build a digital operation center which would allow the mining company operate remotely without exposing employees to the inherent hazards of a mining operation... ","Of course I need to get my Toefl certification, but the most important thing for me is to be able to understand and speak English fluently.","5","Strongly Recommend"
"2","I asked my friends who used to study in LA what is the best English program there, and everyone told me it is ALC... 

.. ","I wanted to improve my writing skills, and to practice my english with other international students.","I used to be so shy speaking with people in English, I wasn..€™t really confident enough to go out there and speak naturally in English... 
but I can easily say that, from the very first month I spent at ALC I gained confidence from my teachers they pushed me to speak more and feel it is ok to make mistakes because ALC is a friendly environment to make mistakes.

Other thing is, I love how everyone in ALC is like a family... ","I guess I would really like it if ALC add more elective classes, such as learning through comedy. I think the best way to understand .. any culture is to know how their sense of humor works!.. ","","","To go to graduate school here in LA.","5","Strongly Recommend"
"3","I learn from the internet... ","It is under control of UCLA. It is creditable... .. ","Content in the reading class","Nothing. Everything is good enough... .. ","It is grate, worth and useful. It is also memorable... ","I had a weaker English skills... ","To improve a speaking skill","5","Strongly Recommend"
"4","I learnt about the UCLA Extension ALC program through my agent in China.","I chose to study at the UCLA Extension ALC Center because I want to improve my English skills and apply for UCLA in the future.","The part I like the best about my American Language Center program is probably the teachers. My teachers (Michael, Joan, Gene) are all really nice, they are very patient to answer all the questions we ask. Their classes are very interesting and helpful for me to improve my English skills... ","We are able to join activities in UCLA which makes me feel like we are a part of UCLA students too. ALC also provides a lot of fun activities for us to make friends and learn about each other.","I went to a high school in Indianapolis, Indiana for my freshman, sophomore, and junior year. After that, because of some personal issues, I went back to my city in China and attended an International school called Dalian American International school. But I have actually been learning English since kindergarten... ","I do not have any work experience, I just graduated from high school last year.","I am planning to join the certificate program, and apply for UCLA undergraduate... ","4","Probably Recommend"
"5","I needed an English intensive program, i found it by searching for the universities i wanted to attend. so ALC had showed up for me... ","Well for the first quarter is to enhance my English language. however, for the other quarters, because i am really benefiting from it and enjoying it... ","I really like the reading class! it do enhance my English in addition to my brain!.. 

of course having a lot of different students from different countries has its own amazing experience.. ","I was thinking of things as, if we are welling to learn something that we can find it in real life, if we have the possiblity to do so. I think the ALC can take us to these places (which is nearby maybe).

Also i like the type of activities they do after the classes! which will help people to know more about it! However, the problem i think is, when i applied to this program in the website i did not see how friendly this place might be. It was just about the time and money and other formal stuff. So if they can put something in the website like we have activities as hiking, speeches, trips, and all other activities they do, would let the people prefer to come to it.

Also, there is picture posting on the instagram or the facebook pages, but if they would have a link to it from the website where who might apply can see it... 

In addition, if i am a non-American student and i want to apply to UCLA. it will be great if it has a link in the main UCLA website ( i don't know if this possible)... 

in General what had been provided is great!","I admit that in ALC it was the best expierance ever. first because it is by native speakers (or non-native that seems perfectly as natives). we are speaking and explaining everything in English and really use it daily and for everything! so this for sure is enhancing it.

before coming here, we been taught by non-native speakers that might get 6-7 on IELTS...  if we don't know something we will be translating it or it will be explained in our language... 

it was like 1-2 hours daily maximum with mostly the teachers are talking not us... ","I was a student all the time, my studies till high school was in my language and after i get to university, i was studying my subjects in English. it did improved I agree but not perfectly, i had a lot of mistakes in grammar (i do now but less).

I'm seeking higher education so I have to improve my language.","Nice Question to be honest... 

they are a lot, but the nearest things would be to keep practicing my english by reading english things (or news).

apply for higher studies, and get a ph. D. I will go back and teach my fellows my subject in english basically.

i will be involved in research... .. ","5","Strongly Recommend"
"6","About one year ago, I wanted to improve my English by studying in LA. UCLA is one of the best universities in LA. I think it must have its own language center, so I did some research and found ALC.","I just answered for question 1.","I think I am lucky. In the first quarter, my teacher was Ben. At that moment, I really needed a Ben-style teacher who always gave me praise and made me confident. Then, when I am at a higher level, Michael is more academic and always pushed us. It was hard to get used to it at first, but when I look back, it's good for me... ","I think some students do not really care about studying. Being studying with them is not only a kind of wasting time, but also decrease the opportunities for making good friends. Also, I am not glad of combining different levels of students together this quarter.","Watching American TV shows.","I am working in the Marketing..  Department of a company for many years.","To study at UCLA.","4","Probably Recommend"
"7","Every thing is perfect","If they can focus more about the pronunciation","From friends","Because my friend told me you are professional and ‏ they have learned English much better then other schools so do I","I went to two language centers one of them was not bad the other one was good at teaching but the teachers and my class mate were very kind","I was working in real stat family company but I was not use computer employees do that I am not sure if that what you want to know but if you ask about ‏ Studying just vocabulary writing and Reading in ELS but the Final test was just about vocabulary and grammar ‏The other one EC or ES Was teaching me about vocabulary and reading but the tests have  questions about right so it was confusing","I want to study about business and communication in English language","5","Strongly Recommend"
